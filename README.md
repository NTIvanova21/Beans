# 📖 About the game 
<h3>Our team decided to make a sudoku type of game. If you don't know what a sudoku is, it's a logic-based puzzle where the player is given a finite number of objects (the numbers from 1 to 9) and a set of conditions stating how the objects must be placed in relation to one another. The puzzle consists of a 9×9 grid further divided into nine 3×3 sub-grids.</h3>
